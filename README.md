# Passwor-generator
I have developed a small password generating website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to help users generate strong and secure passwords for their various online accounts.   It includes a password generator section where users can customize the criteria for their desired password. 

The homepage of the website provides a simple and user-friendly interface. It includes a password generator section where users can customize the criteria for their desired password. This customization may involve choosing the password length, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, or even specific patterns.

Once the user selects their desired criteria, they can click a "Generate Password" button, which triggers the JavaScript functionality behind the scenes. The JavaScript code generates a random password based on the specified criteria.

The generated password is then displayed on the webpage, allowing users to see and copy it. Additionally, there may be an option to toggle the visibility of the password, ensuring that users can securely copy it without compromising its secrecy.

To enhance the user experience, the website's design is crafted using CSS, making it visually appealing and intuitive to navigate. The layout and color scheme of the website are carefully chosen to create a pleasant and engaging experience for users.

Overall, this password generating website provides a convenient and efficient solution for creating strong passwords. By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it aims to simplify the process of generating secure passwords and promotes better online security practices.
